# Private Message System (Filterscript) (Untested)
This is the filterscript of Private Message System which i absolutely cannot test due to laziness.
Feel free to report anything if you found any bug!

# Installation
Head over the [release](/../../releases) page of this repo, and then download the .zip.
Extract it to your filterscript folder and add this in your config.json:
```json
{
    "pawn": {
        // ...
        "side_scripts": ["pm-system"] // add .amx if not working
    },
}
```
